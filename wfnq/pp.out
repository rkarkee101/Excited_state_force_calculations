     Parallel version (MPI), running on    56 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      56
     119846 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./scf1.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :

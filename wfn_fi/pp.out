     Parallel version (MPI), running on   168 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     3 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =     168
     137657 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./scf1.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
